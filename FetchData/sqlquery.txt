insert into complete_train_data2 values ('199842065', 'writing a service that returns an Array of JSON values. At the Service Recipient end, Traversing array is handled using a *ngFor. Each JSON is getting retrieved but I am not able to parse each value inside the JSON. I Am trying to make a list of links, The Json Content is the name of the link and the route to which the link is supposed to be routing.

did try to access the values inside the JSON using the KeyValue pipe. did try to make a custom pipe. did try to call the value like "{{obj.Name}} {{obj.Route}}" in which obj is the json object.

This is the structure of the JSON Array.

const LinkDirectory: ILinks[] =
[
{Name: Home, Route: /home},
{Name: Aboutus, Route: /Aboutus},
];
ILinks is an interface

export interface ILinks {
    Name: string;
    Route: string;
}
This is the Angular Component that receives the service.

export class LinksPopulate implements OnInit {
  LinkDirectory: ILinks[];
  constructor(private DirRetriver: Directory) {}
  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.LinkDirectory = this.DirRetriver.getLinks();
  }
}
Html Code with *ngFor

<div>
      <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let link of LinkDirectory">
      <a routerLink={{link.Route}}>{{link.Name}}</a>
      </li>
      </ul>
</div>
list of links with the specified name. like an all products page in a shopping site'
