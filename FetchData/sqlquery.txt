insert into complete_train_data2 values ('1998423','I am using python3 and I have this code where I ask the user for three inputs. then I perform a calculation on them. I would like to keep adding the calculation results to a list. How to do that?

...

if choice == 1: #my fist input x
    while True:
        x = int(input(Please insert the number of things you consider yourself a fan of))
        if x > 0:
            break
        else:
             print(Please insert a number higher than 0)

elif choice == 2: #my second input y
    while True:
        y = int(input(Please insert the number of hobbies you like to do every month))
        if y % 4 == 0:
            break
        else:
            print(Please insert a valid number)

elif choice == 3: #my third input z
    while True:
        z = int(input(Please insert the number of sports you like))
        if z > 0:
            break
        else:
            print(Please insert a number higher than 0)

elif choice == 4: #the calculation part
    import math
    def square_root():
        c=(42 * y ** 2)/(z + 1)
        nerd_score=int(x*math.sqrt(c))
        return nerd_score
    print(your nerd score is, square_root())
I want the loop to keep going, and each result to be added to the list. until the user exits the loop.', 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0);
