      "title": "Why is else required in if statements when defining a list of items?",
      "body": "<p>When defining a list of items (i.e. not actual list comprehensions), why do you need an else statement to accompany any if statements? For example, using Python 3.7 say that we have some condition which could be true or false, and we want to include an element in a list if the condition is true, and not include it if it's false.</p>\n\n<pre><code>condition = False\nlyst = ['a', 'b', 'c' if condition]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would expect it to assign ['a', 'b'] to lyst, but it throws a syntax error. It works if we include an else statement:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lyst = ['a', 'b', 'c' if condition else 'd']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But now the result is that <code>lyst = ['a', 'b', 'd']</code>\nIn <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2951701/is-it-possible-to-use-else-in-a-python-list-comprehension\">this question</a>, user Plankton's answer further specifies that you can't use a \"pass\" in the else statement. My question is <em>why</em> the else statement is required? Is it so that the list that gets created is guaranteed to have the number of items expected? If so, this strikes me as not very pythonic.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly weird because you <em>can</em> have if statements without else statements in actual list comprehensions e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>post = [x for x in range(10) if x &gt; 5]\n# equivalent to: post = [6, 7, 8, 9]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I realize a list comprehension is totally different functionality. Please remember that my question is <em>why</em> you can't use an if statement without an else in a list literal? Does this limitation avoid some issue I'm not aware of?</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>Is there any way to define a sum type in Java? Java seems to naturally support product types directly, and I thought enums might allow it to support sum types, and inheritance looks like maybe it could do it, but there is at least one case I can't resolve.\nTo elaborate, a sum type is a type which can have exactly one of a set of different types, like a tagged union in C.\nIn my case, I'm trying to implement haskell's Either type in Java:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data Either a b = Left a | Right b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but at the base level I'm having to implement it as a product type, and just ignore one of its fields:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Either&lt;L,R&gt;\n{\n    private L left = null;\n    private R right = null;\n\n    public static &lt;L,R&gt; Either&lt;L,R&gt; right(R right)\n    {\n        return new Either&lt;&gt;(null, right);\n    }\n\n    public static &lt;L,R&gt; Either&lt;L,R&gt; left(L left)\n    {\n        return new Either&lt;&gt;(left, null);\n    }\n\n    private Either(L left, R right) throws IllegalArgumentException\n    {\n        this.left = left;\n        this.right = right;\n        if (left != null &amp;&amp; right != null)\n        {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"An Either cannot be created with two values\");\n        }\n        if (left == right)\n        {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"An Either cannot be created without a value\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    .\n    .\n    .\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried implementing this with inheritance, but I have to use a wildcard type parameter, or equivalent, which Java generics won't allow:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Left&lt;L&gt; extends Either&lt;L,?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I haven't used Java's Enums much, but while they seem the next best candidate, I'm not hopeful.<br>\nAt this point, I think this might only be possible by type-casting <code>Object</code> values, which I would hope to avoid entirely, unless there's a way to do it once, safely, and be able to use that for all sum types.</p>\n"
